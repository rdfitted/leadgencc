# Draft Posts Command

**Command Name:** `draft-posts`

**Purpose:** Generate 15 LinkedIn posts across different categories that align with Ryan Duffy's brand positioning without using client or personal stories.

## Command Instructions:

When this command is executed, Claude should:

1. **Scan Current News:**
   - Use Metaphor MCP server (`mcp__pd-metaphor__metaphor-search`) to gather recent news from business, politics, and sports
   - Use Firecrawl MCP server (`mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_search`) for targeted content extraction from specific sources
   - Prioritize Metaphor for current events, breaking news, and intelligent research-focused searches
   - Use Firecrawl for structured data extraction from business publications and industry sources
   - Analyze each news item for relevance to Ryan's core brand message and automation/systems themes
   - Identify 2-3 news items that can be connected to business automation, readiness frameworks, or systems thinking
   - Note: Only proceed with news-jacking if genuine connections exist - don't force irrelevant connections

2. **Review Reference Documents:**
   - Read `Business_Owners_Mirror_Report.md` for voice, positioning, and signature themes
   - Reference `LinkedIn_Post_Frameworks.md` for structure and hooks
   - Review `LinkedIn_Strategy_Framework.md` and `Kasey_Brown_LinkedIn_Strategy_Transcript.md` for strategic context

3. **Generate 15 Posts Across These Categories:**
   - **Contrarian Takes (3 posts)** - Challenge conventional wisdom in automation/business strategy
   - **Framework Posts (4 posts)** - Share proprietary systems and processes
   - **Industry Insights (4 posts)** - Analyze current trends with expert perspective (prioritize news-jacking opportunities identified in step 1)
   - **Relationship Builders (2 posts)** - Spark conversations without personal stories
   - **Authority Content (2 posts)** - Establish thought leadership positioning

4. **Content Guidelines:**
   - **NO client stories or personal anecdotes**
   - Focus on frameworks, principles, and industry observations
   - Use Ryan's signature themes: "Readiness First," "Every Company Is a Tech Company," "Frameworks Beat Tools," "Narrative as Differentiator"
   - Apply voice prompts: Show blueprints not tools, teach philosophy and practice
   - Ensure each post passes the "$1,000 insight test"
   - Make content valuable to business owners, not just technical audiences

5. **Output Format:**
   - Provide ready-to-copy plain text for each post
   - Include post type label for each
   - Number posts 1-15
   - Keep posts LinkedIn-appropriate length (1-3 short paragraphs)

6. **Quality Checks:**
   - Would a business owner (not a coder) immediately see value?
   - Am I planting a stake in the ground (category-defining)?
   - Does this align with "automation without understanding creates debt" philosophy?
   - Am I showing the blueprint, not just the tool?

## Expected Outcome:
15 high-quality LinkedIn posts that establish Ryan as a systems thinker and business-automation strategist, ready for immediate posting across a 3-4 week content calendar.
