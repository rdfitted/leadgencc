LinkedIn is without a doubt the most powerful platform for executives, employees, CEOs, leaders, founders—whoever you are. It is the most powerful platform to build a personal brand that actually generates revenue, and I'm about to give you the exact strategy that's generated me over $1.2 million for my business. Over the past 16 months I've gone from a measly 2,000 followers on LinkedIn to 44,000 followers, and I've generated $1.2 million directly from the platform. I've had posts hit millions of impressions—I've had one post hit 8.1 million impressions—and I've also been helping executives turn their personal brands into million-dollar assets through my agency.

But here's what I keep seeing happening: Most executives or leaders or CEOs are either posting generic corporate content that gets ignored, or they're not posting at all because they think LinkedIn is just for job hunting and HR stuff or "happy to announce" or "we're hiring." The truth is LinkedIn has evolved into one of the most powerful business-development platforms on the planet. And frankly, while everyone else is still playing it safe with boring content, there's a massive opportunity for executives, leaders, CEOs—just people who understand the platform and know how to use it strategically.

So in this video I'm giving you my complete, no-gatekeeping LinkedIn content strategy and the exact five content types that are going to drive real business results. This is my proven content calendar that you can copy. But more importantly I want you to understand the psychology behind why this works so well for high-level executives, leaders, CEOs, and folks that just want to build brand right now.

**(Disclaimer)** People always ask me, "Kasey, why would you put all this stuff out there?" I need you to understand: There is enough out there for us to all win. Me doing my part and sharing what I'm learning does nothing to impact the wins that I have; it helps you, helps people like you. So please tap into this video, get your notebook, because we're not holding anything back.

## Why LinkedIn is so powerful

LinkedIn isn't just another social platform; it's a business-development engine. Unlike Instagram or TikTok where you're competing for attention with funny videos and dancing, LinkedIn users are already in that business and buying mode. They're thinking about problems, solutions, growth, and revenue. When they see your content they're asking, "Can this person help my business?" You meet your potential client while they're already thinking about business—and on a platform where they're already thinking about these things.

**Background:** My first platform I scaled was TikTok (around 100k followers). But when I went all-in on LinkedIn—even at 5,000 followers—LinkedIn out-performed every other platform, including TikTok. LinkedIn's algorithm right now heavily favors authentic, business-focused content. While everyone else is posting generic motivational quotes or "happy to announce," the platform is starving for real expertise and genuine insights.

**The real secret:** LinkedIn lets you build trust at scale. When someone sees you consistently sharing valuable insights, they think of you as an expert before you even have a sales conversation.

I've seen executives generate six-figure consulting deals, land board positions, and build million-dollar partnerships directly from LinkedIn relationships. It's not about follower counts; it's about influence with the right people.

## How I think about content

It's a business-development funnel, not random posts.

• **Top of Funnel – Authority Content (20-30%):** personal stories, contrarian insights, industry observations. Goal: "This person sees things differently."

• **Middle of Funnel – Value Content (≈60%):** frameworks, case studies, lessons learned. Goal: "I learned something valuable."

• **Bottom of Funnel – Relationship Content (≈20%):** questions, polls, CTAs. Goal: start conversations and move relationships off-platform (newsletter, live event, etc.).

Most people make two mistakes: too much top-of-funnel (turn into influencers with no results) or too much bottom-funnel (come off salesy). The ratio keeps you balanced. I also recommend three posts per week minimum. I used to post six times; now I post 3-4 times and engagement has increased because each post is more thoughtful.

## THE 5 CONTENT TYPES

### 1. Contrarian Take
Challenge conventional wisdom. Works because people are tired of recycled advice. Positions you as an independent thinker. Example: my viral Serena Williams post (8.1M impressions) contrasting her freedom at the Black-centered Super Bowl halftime show vs. criticism at Wimbledon.

**Structure:** bold statement → context/story → why conventional wisdom is wrong → your alternative perspective.

**Hooks:**
– "Everyone says X, but here's why that's backwards."
– "I'm going to lose followers for this, but …"
– "The biggest lie in [industry] is …"

### 2. Behind-the-Scenes Lesson
Share real things you're learning, not textbook theory. Leaders want to see how you handle real situations (difficult client, partnership, stress, team crisis). Example: I waited 11 months to create my first lead magnet—cost me millions.

**Structure:** What happened → What I did (if you want reach, share what you did wrong) → What I learned → How you can apply it.

**Hooks:**
– "I made X mistake last month. Here's what I learned."
– "Three months ago I had to fire a client. Here's why."
– "The conversation that changed my entire business strategy."

### 3. Framework Post
Share your proprietary system or process (decision-making, hiring, onboarding, etc.). People love frameworks because they're actionable.

**Structure:** Memorable name → 3-5 clear steps → brief explanation of each → real-world example.

**Benefit:** gets saved & shared more than any other content type; screenshots in Slack, etc.

### 4. Industry Insight (News-jacking)
Analyze trending news and add your angle. Spend 20-30 min each morning scanning news/Twitter for opportunities.

**Structure:** What happened → What most people are missing (your insight) → What it means for our industry → What to do about it (action).

**Example topics:** funding rounds, product launches, regulatory changes, acquisitions, sports/entertainment moments.

### 5. Relationship Builder
Posts designed to spark conversation and move to DMs (the real business happens there).

**Framework:** Share a perspective/short story → end with a genuine open-ended question.

When someone leaves a thoughtful comment, move to DM, then call, then contract. My highest-value clients came from this chain.

## My weekly cadence (3-4 posts):

• **Monday** – Contrarian take
• **Wednesday** – Framework or BTS lesson
• **Friday** – Industry insight or Relationship builder (people chat on weekends)

**Planning:** Sunday morning I plan the week—review calendar, meetings, news, lessons. Your best content comes from real experience.

## Key Rules & Metrics

**$1,000 Rule:** Before I post, I ask, "Would I pay $1,000 for this insight?" If not, I don't post it.

**Metrics to track (forget vanity):** meaningful DM conversations, email subscribers, meetings booked, deals closed. Quality audience > quantity.

**Timeline expectations:** 6 months to meaningful momentum, 12 months to consistent business results. If you're not willing to play the long game, get out.

## Challenge & Final Thoughts

**Challenge:** Pick one of the five content types and publish a post this week. DM me the link and I'll engage.

Remember: LinkedIn is not about being an influencer—it's about building relationships at scale with people who affect your business.

Your personal brand is your insurance policy and retirement plan. The relationships you build today on LinkedIn will pay dividends for decades.

Will you start before your competition—or after the platform gets saturated like every other one?
