## HOOK EXAMPLES BY CONTENT TYPE

### 1. Contrarian Take Hooks:
• "Everyone says X, but here's why that's backwards."
• "I'm going to lose followers for this, but [insert your take]."
• "The biggest lie in [insert your industry] is..."

### 2. Behind-the-Scenes Lesson Hooks:
• "I made X mistake last month. Here's what I learned."
• "3 months ago, I had to fire a customer/client. Here's why."
• "The conversation that changed my entire business strategy."

### 3. Framework Post Hooks:
• Give your framework a memorable name (e.g., "Personal Brand is Your Retirement Plan")
• Lead with the framework name as your hook

### 4. Industry Insight Hooks:
• "Here's what happened: [insert news]"
• "Here's what most people are missing about [current event]"
• "What [recent news] really means for our industry"

### 5. Relationship Builder Hooks:
• "What's the biggest [industry] mistake you've seen people making?"
• Open-ended questions that reveal business challenges
• "What's your take on [relevant topic]?"

## POST FRAMEWORKS & STRUCTURES

### Contrarian Take Framework:
1. Bold statement that goes against common belief
2. Context/story that illustrates your point
3. Explain why conventional wisdom is wrong
4. Your alternative perspective

### Behind-the-Scenes Lesson Framework:
1. "Here's what happened" - the situation
2. "Here's what I did wrong/right" - the action (sharing mistakes gets more reach)
3. "Here's what I learned" - the lesson
4. "Here's how you can apply this" - the takeaway

### Framework Post Structure:
1. Give it a memorable name
2. Break it down into 3-5 clear steps
3. Explain each step briefly
4. Provide a real-world example of how it works

**Goal:** Someone should be able to read and immediately implement

### Industry Insight (News-jacking) Framework:
1. "Here's what happened" - insert the news
2. "Here's what most people are missing" - your unique insight
3. "Here's what this means for our industry" - the implication
4. "Here's what you should do about it" - the action

### Relationship Builder Framework:
1. Share perspective or experience (brief setup)
2. End with a genuine question that invites others to share thoughts
3. Ask questions that reveal real business challenges you could solve
4. **Follow-up strategy:** Move thoughtful commenters to DMs

## CONTENT CALENDAR STRUCTURE

- **Monday:** Contrarian take (start week strong)
- **Wednesday:** Framework or behind-the-scenes lesson (value content)
- **Friday:** Industry insight or relationship builder (end week with engagement)

**Frequency:** 3-4 posts per week minimum

## THE $1,000 INSIGHT TEST

Before posting anything, ask: **"Would I pay $1,000 for this insight?"**

If not, don't post it. This builds reputation for consistently valuable content.

## EXAMPLE FRAMEWORK IDEAS:

• Your decision-making process
• Your hiring methodology
• Your strategic planning approach
• Your client onboarding system
• Your problem-solving framework

**Note:** These frameworks get saved and shared more than any other content type - often screenshot and shared in Slack channels, saved as computer backgrounds, etc.
