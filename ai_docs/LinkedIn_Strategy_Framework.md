# LinkedIn Strategy Framework

## Key Insights:

• **LinkedIn is a business development engine** - Unlike other social platforms, LinkedIn users are already in a business mindset, making it the most powerful platform for executives, CEOs, and leaders to build revenue-generating personal brands

• **Quality over quantity matters** - Focus on building influence with the right people rather than chasing follower counts. 100 engaged executives are more valuable than 10,000 random followers

• **Content should follow a strategic funnel approach** - Structure your content as a business development funnel with specific ratios: 20-30% authority content, 60% value content, and 20% relationship content

• **Post 3-4 times per week minimum** - Consistency is key, but focus on making each post valuable rather than posting daily with mediocre content

• **The 5 essential content types that drive results:**

  - **Contrarian Takes** - Challenge conventional wisdom in your industry to position yourself as an independent thinker

  - **Behind-the-Scenes Lessons** - Share real experiences, failures, and lessons learned from running your business

  - **Framework Posts** - Provide actionable, step-by-step systems that others can immediately implement

  - **Industry Insights** - Analyze current events and trends with your expert perspective ("newsjacking")

  - **Relationship Builders** - Ask questions and create posts designed to start conversations and move relationships off-platform

• **Focus on business metrics, not vanity metrics** - Track meaningful DM conversations, email subscribers, meetings booked, and deals closed rather than likes and impressions

• **Expect a long-term commitment** - Plan for 6 months to build momentum and 12 months to see consistent business results. LinkedIn is a relationship-building strategy, not a quick win

• **Use the "$1,000 insight test"** - Before posting, ask yourself if you'd pay $1,000 for this insight. If not, don't post it. This builds a reputation for consistently valuable content
