# Proprietary Systems Framework

**For:** Ryan Duffy – Fitted Automation

## Business Frameworks

### Readiness & Opportunity Assessment Framework
A structured audit model that evaluates **Process Standardization → Centralization → Optimization → Automation**. Anchored by pillars like governance clarity, centralized data, automation fit, and business-led strategy.

### Automation Readiness Path
A staged maturity model guiding clients through data inventory, process discovery, governance mapping, ROI evaluation, and AI/automation implementation.

**Core Principle:** Readiness means "Start with the problem. Then measure yourself THREE TIMES."

### "Operational Debt" Framing
Positioning disorganized processes/data as debt that compounds until paid down through standardization.

## Client-Facing Assets

### "OG" Proposal Automation
Podio/Globiflow system that auto-generates proposals, contracts, and SOWs in branded templates (with liability protections baked in for UBS/Southwest).

### AI Readiness Audit & ROI Calculator
Interactive tools and PDFs that help prospects measure where AI fits (avoiding gimmicks) and project ROI before implementation.

### Custom Content & Thought Leadership
You're building a library of AI/automation educational materials, podcasts, and brand-aligned visuals (blueprints, comics, retro-styled diagrams) to position Fitted Automation as both a technical and approachable authority.

## Vertical Solutions

### Trades/Construction Specialization
Tailored automations and AI agents for roofing, solar, general contracting (e.g., Solar Customer Support Agent, Roofing Sales Agent).

### Therapy/Service Industry Agents
Experimentation with vertical-specific AI therapy and customer experience agents.

### AI for Real Estate
POC work targeting fragmented MLS/CRM integrations, privacy/security risks, and client communication flows.
